Planning for day 2

Application chosen is the movie demo.

We could log:
 - whether the imports were successful
    - This would be an critical error
 - A successful query return
    - This would be informational
 - a failure for requests to connect
    - This would be an error
 - if a user did not enter a search term
    - this would be an error
 - if there was an unknown error
    - this would be an error

Steps to add logging are:
    1. Install logbook library
    2. Globally configure how entries will be logged
        1. Initialise logging with a method
        2. Set the level of logging (trace, error etc)
        3. Add a handler for where the logs are destined
    3. Add log level objects
        1. Choose the levels of log
        2. Format your log entry strings with a variable


When choosing the level of logging a WARNING level would be
    for a user who uses the program incorrectly. A ERROR
    is used of the application itself is broken
